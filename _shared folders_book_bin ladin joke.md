**Bin Ladin** was recorded lately calling
the **Arafat** in **Ramallah**:

 

**Bin Ladin: **"Brother - I have risked my life to call you. I have a
burning question that keeps me from my sleep"

 

**Arafat**: "Go ahead Osama - I will try to answer!"

 

**Bin Ladin**: "Well, you guys kill civilians, and I kill civilians...
so why is it you guys get invited to the UN,

the White House to great cocktail parties while silly westerners gather
in their thousands in support 

demonstrations, while I am hunted down and move from hole to retched
hole?"

 

**Arafat**: "Oh - that... this is simple to answer: I only kill Jews!"
